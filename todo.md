# To-do list for Golem

* Modular bodies!
  - Targeted attack system, hp specific to bodypart
  - Attacks, speed, vision etc. from the body parts
* Make things work in the right order (update time -> check if alive -> act)
* Properly stop zombies from sharing a square
* Better field of vision
* Cleaner cave, with corridors only between closest rooms
